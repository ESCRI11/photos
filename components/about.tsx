            I'm a photographer specializing in minimalist, black-coded aesthetics that emphasize form, light, and
            shadow. My work explores the intersection of simplicity and depth, creating visual narratives that speak
            through absence as much as presence.
          </p>

            With over a decade of experience, I've collaborated with brands, publications, and individuals who
            appreciate the power of understated elegance. Each project is an opportunity to distill complex stories into
            their purest visual form.
